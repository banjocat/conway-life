This is a Conway Life Demo written as a Jquery plugin.

A simple example would be done like below
var = life $('selector').life({
    xmax:25,
    ymax:25,
    box_size:10,
});

To restart it, only works correctly with initial: 'random'
life.restart();



This is done completly client side.
While for small amount of users server side would be quicker,
but having a hundread people running this would make the server
have a difficult time keeping up.  If storage was not an issue,
a server could store set patterns to make computation quicker.

This is broken up into two files.  One called life.js is the logic
of the game itself.  The other graphic-life.js uses life.js to display
the graphics. pixi.js was used for the graphical engine. It uses WebGL and
I found it more than quick enough to handle what I was throwing at it.

Other libraries I used are, jquery and underscore.js. I use underscore.js
a lot in my projects I find the utility functions very helpful.


THINGS THAT COULD OF BEEN
The code is setup for setting cells to specific values to start.
Which is done in the unit_tests but I had issues working with pixi.js.
I decided to have it at a working state right now over fixing something
that was not part of the project.

I did add restart so that refershing the page is not required to have
it run again.
